This format works perfectly for:

1. **Your chatbot knowledge base** (clean text, easy to load with LangChain‚Äôs `TextLoader`).
2. **Your professional resume** in PDF/DOC format.

---

If you want, I can now **save this exact text into `yash_resume.txt`** so your chatbot can directly read it without format issues. That will also help with better retrieval in your RAG pipeline.

Do you want me to prepare that `.txt` file for you?
